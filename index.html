      <h2>1. BEAUTY</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>You are the very definition of beauty, not just in how the world sees you, but in how you exist so gracefully in it. Your eyes hold galaxies—soft, deep, and endlessly captivating. One glance from you and my world stills. Your smile lights up rooms, but more than that, it lights up my soul. Your lips carry warmth, your laugh is music, and your presence is peace. Your beauty is not something you wear, it’s something you are—effortless, natural, breathtaking.

But what makes you most beautiful is how your heart shines brighter than any star. You care so deeply, love so fully, and carry yourself with such grace and kindness that it humbles me. The way you comfort, support, and believe in the people you love is nothing short of magical. Your beauty is in your words, your thoughts, and the quiet strength you carry inside.

You are a masterpiece, both inside and out. You don’t just define beauty—you redefine it. And every single day, I find new ways to fall for the way you shine, speak, and simply exist. If beauty had a face, a soul, and a name—it would be yours.</p>

      <h2>2. PROMISE</h2>
      <div class="content">
       <p>My Dearest Apit,

I promise to love you in ways both grand and gentle. I will honor you not only in moments of joy but even more so in trials and storms. I promise to grow with you, to change with you, and to always choose you—every day, no matter what the world throws at us.

I vow to never let you feel alone in this life. I’ll be your biggest fan, your quiet strength, your safe place. I promise to listen without judgment, speak without anger, and hold you when words fall short. I will respect your dreams as if they were my own and build with you a life filled with peace, passion, and shared purpose.

I will never stop learning how to love you better. I will apologize when I’m wrong, forgive quickly, and protect your heart like it’s the most sacred gift I’ve ever received—because it is. I’ll never stop fighting for us.</p>

      <h2>3. ROMANTIC LETTER</h2>
      <div class="content">
        </p>To My Dearest Apit,

You are the sun that never fails to rise in my world, the moon that glows softly through every dark night of my doubts. From the way you laugh like sunlight dancing on water to the quiet strength you carry in your soul, you are poetry in human form. You are a masterpiece made not by brushstrokes but by the grace of every choice you make—and I am endlessly, madly, gratefully in awe of you.

My love, you are not just beautiful—you define beauty. Your eyes, the color of calm days and warm evenings, are twin galaxies where I see home, hope, and healing. Your smile, my babu, has the power to stop time and start it again with a little more magic. And when you laugh—oh baby, when you laugh—the world becomes softer. More forgiving. More alive.

There’s a softness in you that wraps around the hardest parts of life, a gentleness that speaks louder than words. You, bebu, are tenderness in its purest form. But don’t get me wrong—behind that softness is a fire that blazes. Langga, your strength humbles me. You stand firm when others falter. You lift even when you are tired. You fight for what you love, and that... that is why I love you more than words can ever wrap around.

You are the reason flowers seem brighter now, why songs hit deeper, why days have more meaning. You’re the morning coffee that makes life easier, the surprise rain that makes it more poetic. You're a hundred firsts and a thousand forevers, all in one gentle touch, one look from you, sis. You are the reason I try, the reason I hope, and the reason I believe love like ours is real.

My dae, you’re not just someone I love. You are the standard by which I measure all things beautiful, kind, and true.</p>

      <h2>5. LOVE LETTER (Part 2)</h2>
      <div class="content">
        </p>Every word you speak is a note in my favorite song. Every glance from you is a verse I never want to stop reading.

Ms. Otarra, even in your silence, you speak volumes. When you listen, you make me feel like I matter. When you care, you care so deeply that the whole world feels warmer. When you love—oh, lang—you love with a depth that reshapes my soul. I’ve never met someone so passionately alive. So divinely sincere. So incredibly you.

Bab, your kindness isn't loud, but it changes everything around it. Your eyes see the good in others, even when they can’t see it themselves. Your heart forgives even when it hurts. And your soul? Your soul glows. It glows like a lighthouse in a storm, like fireflies in summer—constant, silent, beautiful.

Babi, you are a thousand colors in a world of black and white. You are laughter under the stars and deep talks under the covers. You are both my calm and my chaos. My dream and my reality. My safe place and my greatest adventure.

BB, I would write a thousand books trying to describe what you mean to me, and still fall short. But if I could write one word across the sky every day, it would simply be “Apit”—because that name alone fills me with warmth, joy, and purpose.

Palanga, I don’t just love you. I am in awe of you. You are art, you are soul, you are everything good wrapped in skin and stardust. And if the stars had voices, they would sing your name.</p>
